# Days Code Review #1 (#6)

## Items from previous review

With the conversion from Clean to Days, previous items have to be reinterpreted somewhat.

Some items are no longer relevant since the code identified as problematic simply isn't present in Days:

* [Layout issues](https://github.com/eytanlevit/CleanApp/blob/master/Code%20Reviews/5/5.md#layouts)
* [bugs](https://github.com/eytanlevit/CleanApp/blob/master/Code%20Reviews/5/5.md#bugs)
* [app delegate](https://github.com/eytanlevit/CleanApp/blob/master/Code%20Reviews/5/5.md#app-delegate)
* some specific [optional recommendations](https://github.com/eytanlevit/CleanApp/blob/master/Code%20Reviews/4/4.md#optionals)
* some specific [constant recommendations](https://github.com/eytanlevit/CleanApp/blob/master/Code%20Reviews/4/4.md#constants)

Some items have been explicitly fixed:

* [Swift naming](https://github.com/eytanlevit/CleanApp/blob/master/Code%20Reviews/5/5.md#notifications)
* [precondition](https://github.com/eytanlevit/CleanApp/blob/master/Code%20Reviews/4/4.md#default-cases)
* [threading](https://github.com/eytanlevit/CleanApp/blob/master/Code%20Reviews/4/4.md#threading).  I haven't actually audited any of this, but a cursory read suggests a very serious attempt to root out threading issues was made here.

### Architecture

Last week focused on architecture.  Some improvements were made:

* A chart is now checked into source control that looks plausible
* Some notification patterns were converted to delegates, which is an improvement in clarity

I'm going to re-incorporate some recommendations here that I previously made in an e-mail:

* Labeling the links with the names of the two delegates
* Putting Day at a higher rank order, (e.g. higher on a top-to-bottom or left on a left-to-right chart) to suggest that Day is more truthy than StackCell.  As drawn, itâ€™s at best ambiguous
* Consider merging the patch I wrote on the [stackcell_refactor branch](https://github.com/eytanlevit/Days/tree/stackcell_refactor) (it will need some updating to account for the changes in StackCell.swift in the past week)

## Comment style

I'm noticing a habit of over-verbosity in comments.  For example, this snippit:

```
// fade in card
cardView.fadeIn()
```

Or this one:

```
// send to back
self.sendSubviewToBack(cardView)
```

While comments in general are good, comments of this sort are largely redundant with the code.  This is trouble for a few reasons:

1.  They take time to write
2.  When code changes, the comment explaining them needs to change as well, or else they become misleading over time, which is far worse than no comments at all.  The maintenance burden is significant.
3.  They reduce the amount of code that can fit on the screen, and by extension the amount of code that can fit in the developer's head at once, for no real benefit

Here's an example from a project I work on.  If I had written the code like this:

```objc
[searchDictionary removeObjectForKey:(__bridge id) kSecReturnData]; //remove kSecReturnData
[searchDictionary removeObjectForKey:(__bridge id) kSecMatchLimit]; //remove kSecMatchLimit
```

That's not very helpful.  Instead, I wrote this:

```objc
[searchDictionary removeObjectForKey:(__bridge id) kSecReturnData]; //these two keys cause
[searchDictionary removeObjectForKey:(__bridge id) kSecMatchLimit]; //-50 OSError
```

This comment tells you *why* the keys are being removed.  **Use comments to indicate things that aren't immediately obvious from reading the next line or 2 of code.**



## Potential iPad issue

I've noticed that iPad simulators are consistently hitting the precondition failure

```
fatal error: this is a bug of the API: file /Users/drew/Dropbox/Code/Days/Days/Card.swift, line 72
```

You may want to look into that.

## iPhone 4S Layout

The layout in the 4S simulator looks a little absurd:

![4s](4s.png)

Just generally, I would strongly advise you to look into these device-specific issues rather than try and hack the UIRequiredDeviceCapabilities to exclude affected devices.  Apple frowns on that sort of thing, and it's really really not future-proof.

## Layout issues

Generally, I'm a little puzzled by some things in the layout

* The "topContainer" is installed for wC hR (compact-width regular-height)
* The "bottomContainer" and "tableView" is installed for wA hR (any-width regular-height)

I suspect that only one of these was intended, perhaps they should be configured to match?

## Tableview

I'm puzzled by the (ab)use of a tableview here in general, although to your credit it's not the *strangest* usage of a tableview I've seen, even this month.

However, for the present, I'm going to limit myself to some remarks about UITableView, given that it's a good idea to use (a question which I don't have time to explore in detail).

### Delegates/datasources

One thing I would caution you about is having the delegate and/or datasource of a UITableView (or anything really) being a UIViewController instance.

> There's nothing that says that a UICollectionViewDataSource has to be implemented on your view controller.  In fact, I would encourage you not to implement the data source on your view controller. In fact, I'd go so far as to say, **never ever again implement it on your view controller.**

> I mean, unless you really want to, but what we do here is we implement it as a general NSObject, and then we build those together to build a much more sophisticated data source and this goes a long way to enabling code reuse.  Because as you can imagine, we've got these little classes of data sources that we cobble together and we reuse them all over the place.  And as a result, we wound up with a single view controller for our product detail screen that has only 14 methods.

Instead, your delegate and datasource should be Plain Old NSObjects (PONSOs).  For more on this approach, see WWDC 2014 Session 232.

### Identifiers

For another thing, change all usages of

```
func dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier(_ identifier: String) -> AnyObject?
```

to

```
func dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier(_ identifier: String,
                          forIndexPath indexPath: NSIndexPath) -> AnyObject
```

This is the "new" method that was introduced in iOS6.  Advantages include that it always returns a valid cell, so the nil case does not need to be handled.  As this was the cause for many bugs, adopting the new pattern is to your advantage.
