### Our Sample Library

You can browse the full library above, or use this short summary of select samples. 

[Sample 1](https://github.com/codereviews/samples/blob/master/1/1.md) is a good demo of how we get a less experienced developer quickly up to speed on basics like organising project files, writing better commit messages and taking compiler warnings seriously. 

[Sample 2](https://github.com/codereviews/samples/blob/master/2/2.md) takes on issues with an App Delegate that's doing too many things, it's also a good demo for how reviews follow up on issues.

Other reviews you may find interesting are about [Threading](https://github.com/codereviews/samples/blob/master/3/3.md) or [Architecture](https://github.com/codereviews/samples/blob/master/4/5.md). There are also quick notes about things like [Magic Numbers](https://github.com/codereviews/samples/blob/master/6/2.md#magic-numbers), something which constantly frustrates us when trying to tweak someone else's animation code.
